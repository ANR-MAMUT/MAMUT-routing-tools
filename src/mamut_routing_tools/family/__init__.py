"""Benchmark-family generation: publish the whole family into a marker-rooted
collection tree (slim CVRP / VRPTW instances, shared geo / road / traffic /
distances sidecars, and the TDVRP/TDVRPTW twins of the road-graph v2 td model).

Relocated from ``mamut_routing_publish.td_generation`` (session 34): generation
now lives in the generation tool. Consumes the TD bridge produced by
``mamut_routing_tools.td.traffic`` plus the stage-1 sampling intermediates from
``mamut_routing_tools.generation``.
